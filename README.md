kjumpingcube
==================

This is my own version of KJumpingCube, where the maximum spots a square can hold is equal to the number of neighbors
it has on the board. Once this limit is passed, spots will jump to neighboring squares. The goal is for a player to have
all squares contain spots with her own color.

 An artificial intelligence player option was also created.

The game can be started through simply running Main.java, or a "--display" String argument can be appended to
activate the GUI interface option.
